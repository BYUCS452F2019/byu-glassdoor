I really like this project because I think it solves a 
legitimate problem. This solution could make a big impact
on BYU students and could even stretch out to impact 
students from other universities.  
 
I personally am very business minded. I like to find
solutions to problems or needs in a market. I think
this solution could become a great business if it is
built according to the needs of future customers. In
order to make this project successfully, we will need
to have constant communication with people who will use
it in the future. Basically, it is important for us to
follow the Agile method in creating this project. 
 
As far as the business, legal, and technical aspects,
this project has a huge market, great scalability, and
is a simple solution to a real problem. It is a great idea!
