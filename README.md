# BYU Glassdoor
A college graduate specific Glassdoor instance

## Project Description
Every year a survey goes out to BYU CS students about internship or full-time offers that they have received. That data is temporarily shared with a few people, but is lost from year to year. The vision of this project is to create an MVP for a Glassdoor-type application that is school specific. This would allow students to have as much data as possible to effectively negotiate any offers they receive.

## Team
I'm looking for 1-3 others to join my team. This project can scale to include more features based on team-size

## SQL
Open to suggestions

## No-SQL
Experience with Firebase & MongoDB, but open to suggestions

## Business
There are two options. We could make the implementation university agnostic and build an MVP this semester. Or we could make it BYU specific and see if we can turn upkeep over to BYU OIT or BYU CS after the semester finishes.

## Legal
We will minimize the amount of personal data stored and keep the data as anonymized as possible. There is potential to restrict access to only those within BYU. 

## Technical

### User Interface
A simple React.js or Angular UI. At a minimum, there will be a reporting page. We can use Google Forms for surveying for data if needed.

### Database Architecture
Entities to be stored in the DB includes, but is not limited to:
- Universities
- Users
- Offers
- Interviews
- Companies
