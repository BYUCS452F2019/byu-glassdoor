Response:
I am really interested in this project. I feel like this will be a really useful app, and will help lots of BYU students including me.
I really want to be one of the contributor for this project. I have so many ideas in my head about this project that I want to share.

Contributions:
I know both front-end and back-end. I can help wherever the team needed. I also have some experience with postgreSQL, 
so I can also help with the database building. 

Business, Legal and Technical:
Since Glassdoor has been a really successful app, I believe if we can complete this project well then this BYU-Glassdoor will be really popular.
I hope this app can be a nice tool for BYU students in the future.
I have built some web apps before by using new Angular2,Javascript, Java and postgreSQL with Spring boot framwork. 
If the team require some other languages, I should also know them, but by chance if I don't know the language, I am happy to learn.
